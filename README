* Introduction

This is a project to add speech to Emacs, similar in spirit to Emacspeak but doing things a bit differently.

- Different Software: Instead of using Emacspeak as the engine, this project will use speechd-el to proide spoken and Braille output.
- Community driven: bring the best of the community together to provide a solid basis for configuration.

* Required software for Operation

- speech-dispatcher: the software to drive various speech synthesizers.
- synthesizer: an application to speak output; known good synthesizers are RHVoice and Espeak-NG.
- brltty: for braille displays, if you wish to have Braille output.
