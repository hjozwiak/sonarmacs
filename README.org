* Introduction

This is a project to add speech to Emacs, similar in spirit to Emacspeak but doing things a bit differently.

- Different Software :: Instead of using Emacspeak as the engine, this project will use speechd-el to proide spoken and Braille output.
- Community driven :: bring the best of the community together to provide a solid basis for configuration.

* Required software for Operation

- speech-dispatcher :: the software to drive various speech synthesizers.
- synthesizer :: an application to speak output; known good synthesizers are RHVoice and Espeak-NG.
- brltty :: for braille displays, if you wish to have Braille output.

* Usage

To install Sonarmacs, please clone this repository to .emacs.d like so:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://git.sr.ht/~hjozwiak/sonarmacs
#+end_src

Once you have the repository cloned, copy the config.example.el to your ~/.config/sonarmacs/ directory.

* Getting in Touch

There are a couple of mailing lists that you can join for keeping in touch with Sonarmacs as we evolve the project.
- sonarmacs-discuss :: the general discussion list.
- sonarmacs-devel :: the development mailing list, where patches will be sent to.
- sonarmacs-announce :: for announcements.
